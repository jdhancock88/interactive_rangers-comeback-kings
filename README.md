Series of graphics looking at the Rangers propensity to come from behind or win close, one-run games

##### About this project
The 2016 Texas Rangers won the A.L. West thanks to their knack at winning close games. To be specific, the team went 36-11 in games decided by one run, a modern era baseball record. We took a look at the Rangers' historic season, comparing their record in close games to every other team in baseball. We also took at look at which players performed above the league average in late and close situations.
